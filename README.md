# Horiseon

## Refactoring

The purpose of this is to edit or refactor the existing code to newer or more user friendly code. Existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular Challenge, a marketing agency has hired you to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

* **User Story**: This is a short exercise to practice editing code. 

* **Acceptance Criteria**: This is completed when you have refactored the 'Div' codes to more current code such as 'Header'.

## Refactoring
*This is a summary of the homework assignment.
The purpose of this is to edit or refactor the existing code to newer or more user friendly code. Existing code (improving it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers.
